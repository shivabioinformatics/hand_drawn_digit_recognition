# hand_drawn_digit_recognition


building a hand-drawn digit recognizer using the MNIST dataset and scikit-learn

STEP 1: Build a simple model and ask for input png files and predict what the digit is.
STEP 2: Write a GUI to draw and predict in real-time.
STEP 3: Change the model to have higher accuracy and use PyTorch.
STEP 4: Add this model to the GUI I already built on Step 2.
STEP 5: Maybe build an executable to share.
STEP 6:
